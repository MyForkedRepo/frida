This repository contains various Frida scripts and an intentionally vulnerable Android application. I created this project to demonstrate the capabilities of the Frida dynamic-analysis framework. You can read my ["Introduction to Frida"](https://medium.com/infosec-adventures/introduction-to-frida-5a3f51595ca1) blog post on Medium, where I'm explaining how to use Frida on the included demo application.

## Download

Head over to the releases page, where you can download the debug apk and the Frida scripts.

## Install

You must have Frida installed on your system. You can simply do this with:

```
pip3 install frida-tools
```
